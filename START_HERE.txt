# 🚀 GET STARTED WITH REACT - FIRST TIME GUIDE

**Everything you need to know in 3 steps!**

---

## 📖 WHAT HAPPENED?

You asked to switch from Streamlit to React. Done! ✅

**What changed:**
- ❌ Old: `chatbot_ui_improved.py` - DELETED (duplicate)
- ✅ New: `frontend/` folder with React app
- ✅ Same: Backend still works perfectly
- ✅ Better: Modern, fast, beautiful UI

---

## 🎯 DO THIS FIRST

### 1️⃣ Install Node.js (If you haven't already)

Download: https://nodejs.org/
- Get the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version
- Run the installer
- Follow prompts
- Restart your computer

**Verify it worked:**
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

Both should show version numbers (e.g., v18.0.0, 9.0.0)

---

### 2️⃣ Open Two Terminals

**Terminal 1: Backend**
```bash
cd d:\Projects\PaperClip
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Wait for:
```
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

✅ **Keep this running!**

---

**Terminal 2: Frontend (NEW TERMINAL - don't close the first one)**
```bash
cd d:\Projects\PaperClip\frontend
npm install
```

Wait for it to finish (1-2 minutes). You'll see:
```
added 400+ packages
npm notice
```

Then run:
```bash
npm start
```

Your browser should open to http://localhost:3000 automatically.

**If it doesn't:** Open browser and go to http://localhost:3000 manually.

---

### 3️⃣ Start Using!

You should see:
- **Title:** "PaperClip" in big letters
- **4 buttons:** Chat, Tools, Statistics, Help
- **Input box:** Where you type messages

**Try this:**
```
Type: "Find papers on machine learning"
Press: Enter or Send button
See: AI response appears!
```

## 🎉 YOU'RE DONE!

That's seriously it. You now have a modern React frontend running.

## ❓ QUICK QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I need Python for the frontend?**
A: No! Only Node.js/npm. Python is only for backend.

**Q: Will this slow things down?**
A: Nope! React is actually faster than Streamlit.

**Q: Can I customize colors/theme?**
A: Yes! Edit `src/styles/App.css` - change the `:root` colors

**Q: What if port 3000 is in use?**
A: Run: `npm start -- --port 3001`

**Q: Is backend still working?**
A: Yes! Same FastAPI, same 7 endpoints, same 6 tools.

**Q: Can I deploy this?**
A: Yes! Use Vercel, Netlify, or any static host.
